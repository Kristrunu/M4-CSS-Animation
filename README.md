### Process
I started the project by designing the website in Figma. I decided to make something rather simple, just to get started doing CSS animations, so this is some kind of an online clothing brand landing page.
I used the "inspect" tab in Figma just to make it easier to code the things I created in Figma so the page is not responsive at all. But because it was not a requirement for this project, I was not wasting time fixing it, but I know of the problem and will fix it to finish it later :)

### Animations
After I coded the page, I added the animations. I put hover states on the nav bar, arrow and button, made the dots pulse and the "fall/winter looks" div slides up when loading the page.

### Conclusion
It was fun learning the animation possibilities with CSS and this made me learn better to style divs from scratch. 
Personally, I don’t like things continually moving on websites, messing with my focus but it’s fun to learn it and with time I'm sure I will learn to use it so it does not make me crazy when I look at the page ;)
